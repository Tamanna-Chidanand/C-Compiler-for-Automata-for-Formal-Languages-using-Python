# C-Compiler-for-Automata-for-Formal-Languages-using-Python
Designing a C language Compiler using some constraints such as for loop, while loop, function and variable declarations using Python.
Features
Syntax Parsing: Parses C-like syntax and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Semantic Analysis: Performs type checking and ensures semantic correctness of the code.
Code Generation: Generates intermediate code that can be executed or further compiled to machine code.
Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for syntax and semantic errors.
Requirements
Python 3.x
PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library for parsing and lexical analysis
Usage
Write your C-like code in an .py file.
Run the file:
python3 your_file.py
The output will be generated in an appropriate format, which you can then execute or compile further.
